**AI Web Action Standard (AWAS)** is an open-source specification that enables AI browsers like Atlas, Comet, and other AI agents to interact with websites through machine-readable action definitions‚Äîwithout disrupting traditional human browsing.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Current AI browsers resort to slow, fragile browser automation that mimics human clicking. This approach:

- Is computationally expensive
- Breaks with UI changes
- Provides no semantic understanding
- Creates high server load
- Offers poor user experience

## üí° Solution

AWAS provides a **dual-interface web architecture** where:

- **Human users** browse normally through visual UI
- **AI agents** interact through structured, machine-readable actions

This is achieved through:

1. **AI Action Manifest** - JSON specification of available actions
2. **HTML Data Attributes** - Inline semantic hints for AI agents
3. **Extended Robots.txt** - AI-specific policies and discovery
4. **Discovery Endpoints** - Capability negotiation and metadata
5. **Server Middleware** - Request handling and rate limiting

## ‚ú® Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Zero Breaking Changes** - Works alongside existing HTML/CSS/JS
- ‚úÖ **Progressive Enhancement** - Add incrementally, page by page
- ‚úÖ **Backwards Compatible** - Traditional browsers unaffected
- ‚úÖ **Security First** - Built-in rate limiting, auth, and permissions
- ‚úÖ **Open Standard** - Royalty-free, community-driven
- ‚úÖ **Framework Agnostic** - Works with any backend/frontend stack

## üîó Interoperability

AWAS is designed to be **MCP (Model Context Protocol), A2A (Agent-to-Agent), and ADK (Agent Development Kit) ready**, enabling seamless integration with modern AI agent ecosystems.

### Protocol Support

#### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

AWAS supports MCP through `.well-known/mcp-manifest.json` for standardized AI agent communication:

```json
{
  "name": "awas-site",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "AWAS-enabled site with MCP support",
  "actions": {
    "discover": "/.well-known/ai-actions.json",
    "execute": "/api/ai-actions/{action_id}"
  },
  "capabilities": ["action-discovery", "action-execution", "state-management"]
}
```

**For AI Agents:**
```javascript
// Discover MCP capabilities
const manifest = await fetch('https://example.com/.well-known/mcp-manifest.json');
const actions = await fetch(manifest.actions.discover);
```

#### A2A & ADK Integration

AWAS can be used as a provider in agent-to-agent communication:

```python
# ADK Integration Example
from agent_dev_kit import Provider

class AWASProvider(Provider):
    def discover_actions(self):
        return fetch_awas_manifest(self.base_url)
    
    def execute_action(self, action_id, params):
        return call_awas_action(action_id, params)
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### For Website Owners

1. **Create AI Action Manifest** (`/.well-known/ai-actions.json`):

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "actions": [
    {
      "id": "search_products",
      "name": "Search Products",
      "description": "Search for products in the catalog",
      "method": "GET",
      "endpoint": "/api/search",
      "parameters": [
        {
          "name": "query",
          "type": "string",
          "required": true,
          "description": "Search query"
        },
        {
          "name": "category",
          "type": "string",
          "enum": ["electronics", "clothing", "books"],
          "description": "Filter by category"
        }
      ],
      "response": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "results": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {
                "id": { "type": "string" },
                "name": { "type": "string" },
                "price": { "type": "number" }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

2. **Add HTML Data Attributes** (optional enhancement):

```html
<div data-awas-action="search_products" data-awas-element="search-form">
  <input type="text" name="query" data-awas-param="query">
  <select name="category" data-awas-param="category">
    <option value="electronics">Electronics</option>
    <option value="clothing">Clothing</option>
  </select>
  <button data-awas-trigger>Search</button>
</div>
```

3. **Update robots.txt**:

```
User-agent: *
Allow: /

# AI Agent Directives
AI-Action-Manifest: /.well-known/ai-actions.json
AI-Rate-Limit: 60/minute
AI-Auth-Required: Bearer
```

### For AI Browser Developers

```javascript
const AWAS = require('@awas/client');

const client = new AWAS.Client('https://example.com');

// Discover available actions
const manifest = await client.discover();

// Execute an action
const results = await client.executeAction('search_products', {
  query: 'laptop',
  category: 'electronics'
});

console.log(results);
```
