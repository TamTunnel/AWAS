# Old Scripts

This directory contains legacy development and scaffolding scripts that were used during the early development of AWAS.

These scripts are preserved for historical reference but are no longer actively maintained or needed for the current version of the project.

## Contents

Various Python scripts (script.py, script_1.py through script_15.py) that were used to generate and build documentation structures during development.
